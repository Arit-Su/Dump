Write a program in that contains two variables a and b. Your task is to swap the values of a and b such that the value of a gets stores in b and value of b gets stores in a.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    int a = scanner.nextInt();
    int b = scanner.nextInt();

    // Write your logic here to swap a and b
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;

    /* Do not alter or remove the below code */
    System.out.println(a);
    System.out.println(b);
    System.out.print("-");
  }
}
