Write a Java program that prints out the first 100 even numbers on the terminal.

Note: You need to print first 100 even numbers, not even numbers between 1 - 100.
You don't need to get any input from the user.

public class Main {

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    // Write your code here...
    int found = 0;
    int currentNumber = 1;

    while (found <= 100) {
        if(currentNumber % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(currentNumber);
            found++;
        }
        currentNumber++;
    }
  }
}
